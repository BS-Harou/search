Search window is an extension for Opera Browser.

It gives you quick access to many customizable tools like searching and translating and just by selecting some text on any webpage.

By default there are buttons for Google, Wiki and Google Translator.

Note: The Google translator translates from English to Czech language. To change the languages use options page.

In options page you can add your own buttons and remove or edit the default set of buttons.

The button url uses same syntax as Opera search - use %s to determine where to put selected text to url.
